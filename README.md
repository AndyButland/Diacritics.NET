# Diacritics.NET
Diacritics are used across many languages in order to change the sound-values of the letters to which they are added.
In software development, diacritics often have to be replaced with non-diacritics, e.g. to improve usability of user input.
Diacritics.NET is a basic mapper between diacritic characters an non-diacritic characters.
